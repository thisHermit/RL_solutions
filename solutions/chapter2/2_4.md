### Q: If the step-size parameters, ↵n , are not constant, then the estimate Qn is a weighted average of previously received rewards with a weighting di↵erent from that given by (2.6). What is the weighting on each prior reward for the general case, analogous to (2.6), in terms of the sequence of step-size parameters?

A:

$$
Q_{n+1} = \sum_{i=0}^{n-1}\alpha_{n-i}R_{n-i}\prod_{j=1}^{i} (1-\alpha_{n-j-1}) + Q_{1} \prod_{i=0}^{n-1} (1-\alpha_{n-i})
$$
