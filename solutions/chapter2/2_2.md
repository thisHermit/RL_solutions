### Consider a k -armed bandit problem with k = 4 actions, denoted 1, 2, 3, and 4. Consider applying to this problem a bandit algorithm using e-greedy action selection, sample-average action-value estimates, and initial estimates of Q1 (a) = 0, for all a. Suppose the initial sequence of actions and rewards is A1 = 1, R1 = 1, A2 = 2, R2 = 1, A3 = 2, R3 = 2, A4 = 2, R4 = 2, A5 = 3, R5 = 0. On some of these time steps the e case may have occurred, causing an action to be selected at random. On which time steps did this definitely occur? On which time steps could this possibly have occurred?

A:
The steps it occurred on:

Possibly: 1

Definitely: 4, 5
