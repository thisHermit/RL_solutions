### Q: Can you think of other ways to improve the reinforcement learning player? Can you think of any better way to solve the tic-tac-toe problem as posed?

A: A better way would be to decrease the chance of exploration to almost zero as time moves on. We can also go completely exploratory until a specified amount in time and then go completely exploitative.
